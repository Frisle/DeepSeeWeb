# Installation
1. First be sure, that you have [MDX2JSON](https://github.com/intersystems-ru/Cache-MDX2JSON) installed. To test it open URL `<server:port>/MDX2JSON/Test`
You should see something like this:
`
{
	"DefaultApp":"\/mdx2json",
	"Mappings": {
		"Mapped":["MDX2JSON","SAMPLES"
		],
		"Unmapped":["%SYS","DOCBOOK","USER"
		]
	},
	"Status":"OK",
	"User":"UnknownUser",
	"Version":2.2
}
`

2. Download the latest release xml file: https://github.com/intersystems-ru/DeepSeeWeb/releases
3. Import it to any CachÃ© namespace, f.e. to USER.
4. Run in terminal:
```
USER> d ##class(DSW.Installer).setup()
```
It will:
* create /dsw web app, 
* create ...csp/dsw folder 
* put all the necessary DeepSee Web files into .../csp/dsw folder.

To use DSW Open `server:port/dsw/index.html`

# Known issues:

Sometimes after installation you can see umlyauts in the client. like in the shot:
![Install](/installbug.png?raw=true "Installbug screenshot")
To fix this there are tow ways:
* Copy index.html to index.csp and try to connect to it same way you do with index.html page. Symbols should go in Unicode now.

Or:

* Write your current codepage setting in CSP Gateway for the files:
```
zw ^%SYS("CSP","DefaultFileCharset")
```
This setting should be "utf-8". If there is another setting, save it somewhere and change to "utf-8" 

So this should fix it:
```
set ^%SYS("CSP","DefaultFileCharset")="utf-8"
```
# Creating custom widgets
DeepSeeWeb allows modification of exist widgets and custom widget registration as well.
For base widget class methods and properties description please read [Addons](Addons.md).
To setup custom widget simply copy widget js file to `/addons` folder.

For custom widget example, please look at [src/factories/customWidget.js](src/factories/customWidget.js). This is simple custom widget that represents html5 canvas for drawing. 

# Creating custom themes
User can create or use custom themes, more about it here: [Custom themes](doc/themes.md).
